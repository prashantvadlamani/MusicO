This is a music streaming web application which was built by a team of 6 members.

As a part of Web Development course we have created this project. This project simulates a music streaming web application where the users can search for an album/songs and can play them.

The front-end of the project is built using ReactJS, Material UI and bootstrap. The back-end of the project is built using Springboot and the data is stored in MySQL database.

The albums are stored in AWS S3 bucket and the access link to these albums are stored in MySQL database.
